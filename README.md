SPACAL_CALCULATOR_Streamlit

The project's aim is to make an interface for Moliere Radii and Radiation length calculation for SPACAL module for LHCb experiment. 

As of 17.07.2023 project has very old and not maintained code, but has chances to be reborn (let's see :D). 

Streamlit version is available at: [Streamlit APP](https://share.streamlit.io/princerichfather/spacal_calculator_streamlit/main/app.py "Streamlit SPACAL CALCULATOR")
